# 🌍 Global Climate & Air Quality Performance Analysis

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard analyzing global temperature trends, air quality patterns, environmental conditions, and safety classification metrics.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project transforms global environmental data into an interactive analytical dashboard to evaluate climate behavior and pollution performance across countries.

The dashboard enables users to explore:

- Global temperature trends
- Air Quality Index (AQI) performance
- Pollutant concentration analysis
- Environmental safety classification
- Regional environmental comparisons

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze global temperature patterns
- Evaluate AQI and pollutant concentration
- Identify environmentally safe and high-risk regions
- Compare environmental drivers affecting safety levels
- Support data-driven environmental insights

---

## 👥 Target Audience

- Environmental Analysts
- Policy Makers
- Climate Researchers
- Urban Planning Authorities
- Data Analysts
